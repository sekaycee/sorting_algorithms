# Sorting algorithms

Project completed during **Fullstack Software Engineering** program at **ALX**. It aims to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash
* C files are compiled using GCC
* Tested on Ubuntu

## Files
